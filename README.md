# Andipha-Mankayi
# 👋 Hi there, I'm Andipha Mankayi!

I'm a qualified somatologist transitioning into software development. With a strong background in wellness, client care, and aesthetics, I've developed an eye for detail and a deep appreciation for user-centered design. Currently, I'm learning web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and working on beginner projects to sharpen my skills, open-source collaboration, and continuous learning. My goal is to merge my wellness experience with technology to create beautiful, functional, and accessible digital solutions.
